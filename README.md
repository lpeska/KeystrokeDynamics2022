### Abstract:
In this paper, we focus on the problem of userâ€™s
authentication through typing dynamics patterns. We specifically
focus on small-sized problems, where it is difficult to fully
train corresponding machine (deep) learning algorithms from
scratch. Instead, we propose a different approach based on the
visualization of the typing patterns and subsequent usage of pre-
trained feature extractors from the computer vision domain. We
evaluated the approach on a publicly-available dataset and results
indicate that this is a viable solution capable to improve over
several baselines. Moreover, the proposed visual representation
of the data contributes to the explainability of AI.
